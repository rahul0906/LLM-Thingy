I'd like the answers to be fairly accurate - creating explicit summaries of cited documents. So... let's do that!\n\nBelow, we'll use the [`langchain`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/tree/master) and Huggingface `transformers` libraries to:\n1. Load a set of interesting ML papers.\n2. Build a searchable vector database using [`FAISS`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) and `sentence-transformer` embeddings.\n3. Query the database with an ML question we have!\n\nKaggle notebooks come pre-loaded with a huge set of Python modules.

This\\npaper presents evidence that, despite their size and complexity, LMs sometimes\\nexploit a computational mechanism familiar from traditional word embeddings:\\nthe use of simple vector arithmetic in order to encode abstract relations (e.g.,\\nPoland:Warsaw::China:Beijing ). We investigate a range of language model sizes\\n(from 124M parameters to 176B parameters) in an in-context learning setting, and\\nfind that for a variety of tasks (involving capital cities, upper-casing, and past-\\ntensing), a key part of the mechanism reduces to a simple linear update applied\\nby the feedforward networks. We further show that this mechanism is specific\\nto tasks that require retrieval from pretraining memory, rather than retrieval from\\nlocal context. Our results contribute to a growing body of work on the mechanistic\\ninterpretability of LLMs, and offer reason to be optimistic that, despite the massive\\nand non-linear nature of the models, the strategies they ultimately use to solve tasks\\ncan sometimes reduce to familiar and even intuitive algorithms.1\\n1 Intro\\nThe growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have led to an equally growing interest in\\nunderstanding how such models work under the hood. Such understanding is critical for ensuring that\\nLLMs are reliable and trustworthy once deployed. Recent work (often now referred to as “mechanistic\\ninterpretability”) has contributed to this understanding by reverse-engineering the data structures and\\nalgorithms that are implicitly encoded in the model’s weights, e.g., by identifying detailed circuits\\n[Wang et al., 2022, Elhage et al., 2021, Olsson et al., 2022] or by identifying mechanisms for factual\\nstorage and retrieval which support intervention and editing [Geva et al., 2021b, Li et al., 2022, Meng\\net al., 2022a,c, Dai et al., 2022].\\nHere, we contribute to this growing body of work by analyzing how LLMs recall information during\\nin-context learning. Specifically, we observe that the mechanism that LLMs use in order to retrieve\\ncertain facts (e.g., mapping a country to its capital city) bears a striking resemblance to the type of\\nvector arithmetic operations associated with LLMs’ simpler, static word-embedding predecessors.\\nThat is, early word embeddings such as word2vec [Mikolov et al., 2013] famously supported factual\\nrecall via linear vector arithmetic–e.g., there existed some vector that, when added to the vector\\n1Code available at: https://github.com/jmerullo/lm_vector_arithmetic\\nPreprint.

We also include results from a standard polynomial SVM implemented via scikit-learn\\n(svm.SVC(kernel=‘poly’) ) for comparison. We ﬁnd that for the Codex model family, the\\nlargest model can successfully perform linear classiﬁcation up to N= 64 , while the smaller models\\nreach guessing performance at approximately N= 16 . For PaLM models, on the other hand, model\\nscale does not seem to signiﬁcantly correlate with the number of dimensions to which the model can\\nperform linear classiﬁcation, though all PaLM models can perform linear classiﬁcation up to at least\\nN= 8.10Neither PaLM models nor Codex models can outperform an SVM baseline.\\nThese results suggest that model size alone does not necessarily unlock the ability to perform linear\\nclassiﬁcation at high dimensionality (since PaLM-540B does not outperform PaLM-8B or PaLM-\\n62B), but instead imply that there is another scaling factor seen in the Codex models that allows this\\nability to emerge.

Large language models are neural networks that are used to generate text, and they often use embedding spaces to represent words or phrases. However, the exact relationship between these two concepts depends on the specific implementation and design of the large language model. Some large language models may use pretrained embedding spaces, while others may train their own embedding spaces as part of the model training process. Additionally, different embedding spaces may be used for different purposes within the model architecture, such as for input representation, output representation, or for intermediate layers. Ultimately, the choice of embedding spaces and how they are used can impact the performance and generalizability of the large language model.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the relationship between LMQA and linear regression algorithms? \n \n\nAnswer&Explanation:\nLinear regression algorithms are a subset of LMQA, specifically when the value of m = 1. LMQA is a more general framework that includes linear regression algorithms as a special case, along with many other types of machine learning algorithms. LMQA stands for learning machines with quadratic activation, and it refers to a class of machine learning algorithms that use quadratic functions as their activation function. In linear regression, the activation function is simply a linear function, whereas in LMQA, the activation function is a quadratic function. So, LMQA is a broader framework that encompasses linear regression algorithms and many other types of algorithms as well.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the purpose of the in-context exemplars parameter k in Algorithm 1? \n \n\nAnswer&Explanation:\nIn Algorithm 1, the parameter k represents the number of exemplars per class that are used to generate\\nevaluation examples for N-dimensional linear classiﬁcation. Each evaluator is given a ground truth coefﬁcient\\na and a pivot point p. Then, in-context exemplars are generated by randomly sampling N-D vectors\\nconditioned on being either greater than or less than the threshold between positive and negative\\nexamples, determined by comparing the inner product between the vector and the ground truth coefﬁcient.\\nThese in-context exemplars are then used to generate evaluation examples. k controls the number of such\\nexemplars per class that are used in the evaluation process. A larger k will result in more in-context\\nexemplars being used, which could potentially lead to better performance in the evaluation process.\n\nQuestion:\nIn experiments that compare 16- and 32-bit floating point precision in the paper, what is the \\nreason for choosing these two values? \n \n\nAnswer&Explanation:\nThe reason for choosing 16-bit and 32-bit floating point precision is to examine the effect on accuracy\\nwhen using different levels of numerical precision in the model calculations. Floating point numbers\\nanalyze real numbers with a certain level of precision, and the larger the number of bits used, the higher\\nthe accuracy. Therefore, by comparing the accuracy obtained with 16-bit vs 32-bit precision, we can\\nget a sense of how much precision is necessary for accurate model calculations.\n\nQuestion:\nIs the relationship between linear classiﬁcation and large language models studied only on Codex models? If so, why was the study limited to Codex models? \n \n\nAnswer&Explanation:\nThe study was not limited to Codex models; the authors also included PaLM models in their analysis. The\\nstudy was conducted on both Codex and PaLM models because they are representative of two\\ndifferent categories of language models: Codex is a contextual language model, while PaLM is a\\nnon-contextual language model. By including both types of models, the authors were able to get a \\nmore comprehensive view of how linear classiﬁcation relates to large language models across different\\ncategories.\n\nQuestion:\nAre the linear classiﬁcation results for Codex models and PaLM models comparable? \n \n\nAnswer&Explanation:\nIt is difficult to compare the linear classiﬁcation results for Codex models and PaLM models directly, as they\\nuse different model architectures and training procedures. However, the authors provide relative\\ncomparisons of the paired model families to illustrate differences in performance. Specifically, the Codex\\nfamily performs better on linear classiﬁcation compared to the PaLM models. It is important to note that\\nbecause the Codex models are contextual, they have access to more information about the input text and\\nmay therefore be better equipped to handle linear classiﬁcation tasks.\n\nQuestion:\nCan the Codex models outperform a standard SVM baseline on linear classiﬁcation for datasets larger than\\n64 dimensions? \n \n\nAnswer&Explanation:\nThe results presented in the paper indicate that the Codex models cannot outperform a standard SVM baseline\\nfor datasets larger than 64 dimensions. This is due to the limitations of the Codex models themselves. The\\nstudy shows that the Codex models struggle to perform linear classiﬁcation for datasets larger than 64\\ndimensions, and hence are unable to outperform an SVM baseline. The authors also note that the Codex family\\nof models does not show a clear pattern of scalability beyond 64 dimensions, suggesting that the models\\nare not designed to handle larger datasets effectively.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the purpose of the evaluation examples procedure in Algorithm 1? \n \n\nAnswer&Explanation:\nThe evaluation examples procedure in Algorithm 1 is used to evaluate the performance of the model on a set\\nof evaluation examples, generated using in-context exemplars per class. The purpose of this procedure\\nist to determine whether or not the model can perform N-dimensional linear classiﬁcation by comparing\\nthe inner product between the vector and the ground truth coefﬁcient. The results of the evaluation process\\nwill help us understand the model's performance on N-dimensional linear classiﬁcation tasks.\n\nQuestion:\nWhy is random guessing used as a baseline in comparing the results of the Codex models to those of the\\nstandard SVM algorithm? Is random guessing a valid comparison for linear classiﬁcation tasks? \n \n\nAnswer&Explanation:\nRandom guessing is used as a baseline in comparing the results of the Codex models to those of the standard\\nSVM algorithm because it provides a simple and easily achievable benchmark against which the Codex models\\ncan be evaluated. In the context of linear classiﬁcation tasks, random guessing is generally considered\\ninadequate due to the lack of any meaningful underlying structure or pattern in the data. However, since\\nthe Codex models themselves have demonstrated strong performance on linear classiﬁcation tasks,\\nit is\\nimportant to establish a baseline to assess their performance relative to a more sophisticated algorithm.\\nTherefore, while random guessing may not be ideal as a comparison for linear classiﬁcation tasks in general,\\nit\\nis still useful as a reference point for evaluating the Codex models.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the rationale behind using SVMs as a baseline for the Codex models? Are SVMs inherently suited\\nto linear classiﬁcation tasks? Do SVMs use the same embedding spaces as the Codex models? \n \n\nAnswer&Explanation:\nThe rationale behind using SVMs as a baseline for the Codex models is to provide a comparison point for\\ntheir performance on linear classiﬁcation tasks. While SVMs are typically used for classification and\\nregression problems, they can also be used for linear classiﬁcation tasks. Although SVMs may not be as\\ndirectly suited to linear classiﬁcation tasks as other algorithms, they are a commonly used baseline\\nin research studies due to their simplicity and wide applicability. Furthermore, SVMs can be adapted to\\nwork with various embedding spaces, making them versatile in terms of their compatibility with different\\nkinds of input data. However, it should be noted that whether or not SVMs use the same embedding spaces\\nas the Codex models depends on the speciﬁc implementation and design of the models.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the purpose of the xtrain and ytrain variables in Algorithm 1? \n \n\nAnswer&Explanation:\nThe xtrain and ytrain variables in Algorithm 1 represent the training data for the linear classiﬁcation\\ntask. xtrain contains the input data (features or attributes) and ytrain contains the corresponding labels\\n(target values or outcomes). These variables are used to train the model on the linear classiﬁcation task,\\nand the resulting model is then tested on the x\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
